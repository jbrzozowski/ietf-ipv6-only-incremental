   network management, telemetry, and the operations and support for the

   IPv6 only network.  Recommendations and best practices for operations
   and support will be provided, however, alternate approaches may be
   utilized.  Disabling or removal of IPv4 stacks is out of scope for
   this document.  This document focused on the explicit provisioning of
   IPv6 only using NAT64 RFC6146 [RFC6146] and DNS64 RFC6147 [RFC6147]
   to access IPv4 only content, services, and applications.

2.  Design Principles

2.1.  Infrastructure (Network)

   The following a specific network design details that are minimally
   required to support an IPv6 only network that utilized NAT64 and
   DNS64.  The following have been drawn from real deployment scenarios
   for large scale uses of IPv6 only with NAT64 and DNS64.  The
   parameters specified here are specific to providing IPv6 only
   connectivity.  It is assumed that IPv6 only is provisioned and that
   IPv4 stacks remain active on network and host interfaces.  The
   disabling or removal of IPv4 stacks from hosts or routers is out of
   scope for this document.  As such it is important to note that link
   local IPv4 RFC3927 [RFC3927] will likely remain active and will
   appear on hosts and network infrastructure.

   The following section outlines the requirement to provisioning IPv6
   only.  We minimally assume that SLAAC will be utilized, however, for
   completeness the parameters required for DHCPv6 RFC3315 [RFC3315] and
   RFC3736 [RFC3736]are also provided:

   o  IPv6 only - hosts are expected to be provisioned with IPv6 only
      connectivity, however, link local IPv4 is likely to be present.

   o  RA interval is minimally recommended to be set to 4 seconds.

   o  At least one prefix information option (PIO) must be included in
      router advertisements, the transmitted PIO must correspond to the
      IPv6 prefix that is valid for a given IPv6 link.

   o  The use of SLAAC RFC4862 [RFC4862] must be signalled by the
      network, specifically for each transmitted PIO the A but must be
      set to 1 (one)

   o  DHCPv6 support should be included but is not required, as such
      both the M and O bits must be set to 1 (one).  Whether stateless
      or stateful DHCPv6 is used both the DNS Server IPv6 address and
      DNS Search List options RFC6106 [RFC6106] must minimally be
      included.  The DNS server IPv6 address(es) must be those used for
      DNS64.  It is recommended that these values be identical to those
      used in the IPv6 router advertisements that include the RDNSS



Brzozowski, et al.     Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


      RFC6106 [RFC6106] options.  If DHCPv6 support is deployed
      stateless DHCPv6 must minimally be available.

   o  IPv6 router advertisements must include the RDNSS options.  Both
      the DNS Server IPv6 address(es) and DNS-SL are required.  If
      DHCPv6 support is deployed the values sent here for RDNSS are
      recommended to match those sent via DHCPv6.

   To ensure seamless and to support an incremental deployment of IPv6
   only access to legacy dual stack infrastructure should remain
   available.  The following are recommended approaches that may be
   considered to achieve the same.

   o  The deployment of IPv6 only with NAT64 and DNS64 may very well
      help to identify applications, services, or use cases that are not
      entirely compatible with the same.  It is therefore important to
      ensure that users of IP networks, whether wired or wireless, have
      access to legacy dual stack infrastructure as a fallback.  For
      wireless network it is recommend to have a secondary SSID labelled
      accordingly, e.g. example-ssid-dual-stack or example-ssid-legacy.
      For wired network connectivity having secondary ports that are
      dual stack enabled is also recommended.

   This document assumes that dual stack connectivity is available by
   default and that IPv4 only connectivity is no longer supported.  As
   such it is out of scope for this document outline fallback or access
   to legacy connectivity that is IPv4 only.

3.  Network Services

   The following network services are required for an IPv6 only where
   support for and access to IPv4 content, services, and applications
   are required.

3.1.  DNS64

   The following recommendations apply to the use and deployment of
   DNS64:

   o  Use of the well known DNS64 prefix per RFC6052 [RFC6052]

   o  It is also recommended that query logging be enabled for DNS64,
      performance impacts of query logging must be noted but are largely
      out of scope for this document.  Query logging is essential to
      determine the volume and make up of DNS queries and replies that
      are are specific to DNS64 and IPv4 only content, services, and
      applications.

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


3.2.  NAT64

   The following recommendations apply to the use and deployment of
   NAT64:

   o  DNS64 is a critical aspect to direct requests from IPv6 only hosts
      to a NAT64 service.

   o  NAT64 configurations vary widely, port allocation techniques are
      largely out of scope for this document.  One-to-one (1:1) mappings
      can be used to allocate an IPv4 address per connected device or
      alternatively blocks of IPv4 ports can also be assigned per
      device, each has different properties.  It is generally
      recommended to allocate IPv4 ports per device in an effort to
      maximize IPv4 utilization for NAT64.

3.3.  DHCPv6

   Support for DHCPv6 may be required in some deployments.  If required,
   parameters pertaining to IPv6 router discovery may requirement
   adjustment.  The following outlines the guidance specific to the use
   of DHCPv6:

   o  Stateless DHCPv6 SHOULD be supported to facilitate the
      transmission of DNS servers IPv6 address(es) and DNS search lists.

   o  Stateful DHCPv6 for address assignment MAY be supported, but is
      not required.  If stateful DHCPv6 is used the DNS parameters
      mentioned above must be included.

   o  While stateful DHCPv6 is not strictly required for host
      addressing, if support for IPv6 prefix delegation becomes
      necessary stateful DHCPv6 will likely be mandatory. (see Future
      Work) The details of IPv6 prefix delegation is out of scope for
      this document.

4.  User Equipment

   Host Address Assignment and Configuration:

   o  Hosts MUST support SLAAC

   o  Hosts SHOULD support RDNSS [RFC6106] for the acquisition of DNS
      server IPv6 addresses and a DNS Search List

   o  Hosts MAY support DHCPv6 for address acquisition, the use of
      DHCPv6 for address acquisition is not prohibited




Brzozowski, et al.     Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


   o  DHCPv6 option to configure DNS server option 23 and domain search
      list option 24 [RFC3646] address MUST be implemented if DHCPv6 is
      to be utilized

   IPv4 support:

   o  The IPv4 stacks of hosts MAY remain enabled, which means that Link
      Local IPv4 [RFC3927] (168.254/16) addresses MAY continue to be
      present and in use.  Disabling of the IPv4 stack of hosts is out
      of scope for this document.

   o  Hosts MUST support connecting to IPv4-only servers by using the
      NAT64/DNS64.  Possible solutions include 464XLAT [RFC6877], "Bump-
      in-the-Host" [RFC6535] and Happy Eyeballs v2 [draft-ietf-v6ops-
      rfc6555bis]

5.  Network Management

   The focus of this document is user equipment and hosts.  The network
   and network service requirements are oriented around providing IPv6
   only connectivity to use to allow for the use of NAT64 and DNS64 to
   maintain reachability to IPv4 only content, applications, and
   services.  Operations and management of the underlying network is
   technically out of scope for this document, however, given the
   relevance of the same to the focus of this draft some guidance is
   being provided.

   Strictly speaking the primary requirement for the underlying network
   is that IPv6 is supported along with the services required to enable
   the use of NAT64 and DNS64.  This suggests that the underlying
   network could in fact be dual stack for management and operations.
   It is required that the provisioning of IPv4 for user equipment and
   host connectivity not be supported.  User equipment or host facing
   interfaces must not have following:

   o  Non-link local IPv4 addresses

   o  DHCPv4 is not supported or enabled

   o  DNS services over IPv4 is not supported or enabled

   Given the above, within a given VLAN it is possible and likely that
   IPv4 may be observed, present, and possibly used.  It is out of scope
   for this document to prevent the use of IPv4 entirely.

   Depending on the level of readiness IPv6 only network management may
   or may not be possible.  Network management and operations includes
   but is not limited to the following:



Brzozowski, et al.     Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 6]

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


   o  Remote access to network infrastructure via SSH or telnet

   o  Remote SNMP communications

   o  Remote NETCONF communications

   o  Remote Syslog communications

   While it is strongly recommended that all network management and
   operations be performed over IPv6 only it is not strictly required.
   However, it is important to note that the presence and use of IPv4
   for network management and operations must not impede or impact the
   use of IPv6 only with NAT64 and DNS64.

6.  Telemetry and Monitoring

   At this point in time, IPv6-only networks with no IPv4 support at all
   are still not widespread and may expose issues in host operating
   systems or applications.  It is therefore recommended to establish
   telemetry of how hosts are getting addresses provisioned and
   accessing the Internet.  In order to preserve the privacy of users of
   the network, it is paramount that connectivity information (e.g.
   DNS64 records) cannot be correlated with individual client nodes.

   We can measure how hosts:

   o  Configure IPv6 addresses (SLAAC, DHCPv6) and which ones they use

   o  Configure DNS server addresses (RDNSS vs DHCPv6)

   We can measure what percentage of the traffic:

   o  Uses native IPv6

   o  Uses NAT64

   Recording the most common hostnames that require the DNS64 to
   synthesize would also allow to establish a list of the most prominent
   IPv4-only services.

   Observing the TCP/UDP ports used by applications that still leverage
   IPv4 link-local on an IPv6-only network will also help prepare for
   the time when routers stop switching IPv4 traffic altogether.

   Given that some users may have devices running legacy IPv4-only
   software, the network should provide a different fallback network
   that is dual-stack.  It is worth measuring the number of users that

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


   switch to this network, and possibly use an anonymous survey asking
   users what software failure caused them to switch.

7.  Support for User Applications and Services

   Following is a list of commonly used applications and services that
   are expected to operate, without incident, when used in an IPv6 only
   environment that utilizes NAT64 and DNS64.  The list below is not
   exhaustive.

   o  VPN

   o  Chat

   o  Email

   o  SSH/Telnet

   o  Git

   o  Voice

   Recording the most common hostnames that require the DNS64 to
   synthesize would also allow to establish a list of the most prominent
   IPv4-only services.

   Observing the TCP/UDP ports used by applications that still leverage
   IPv4 link-local on an IPv6-only network will also help prepare for
   the time when routers stop switching IPv4 traffic altogether.

   Given that some users may have devices running legacy IPv4-only
   software, the network should provide a different fallback network
   that is dual-stack.  It is worth measuring the number of users that
   switch to this network, and possibly use an anonymous survey asking
   users what software failure caused them to switch.

8.  Support and Operations

   Most every network has customers or end users of some sort, therefore
   it essential to ensure that end users or consumers of the have means
   to do the following while transitions are occurring in networks and
   related infrastructure.  One key item referenced earlier is the
   availability of temporary fallback networks that support legacy
   communications.

   The following outline additional items that end users must have
   available to communicate with network operators.  All of the items
   below must be available via dual stack connectivity.

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


8.1.  Reporting Issues (Ticketing)

   Tools and systems that can be used to report issues with
   applications, services, or content must be available for end-users.
   Network and systems operators are responsible for acknowledging and
   classifying issues and ultimately ensuring that the same are properly
   addressed.  Specifically to this document "fixed" is meant to imply
   that proper support for IPv6 is available.  In some cases network and
   system operators may need to implement temporary workarounds to
   ensure that end users can access the desired content, application, or
   service.

8.2.  Interactive support (Slack, email)

   Interactive support is often desired in lieu or in conjunction with
   traditional support models like trouble ticket creation.  It is
   recommended that interactive support be available via real time and
   near real time mechanisms like Slack or electronic mail (e-mail).

9.  Known Client-side Issues

   Following are known client side issues that are specific to the
   deployment of IPv6 only networks and/or the use of NAT64/DNS64:

   o  Use of literal IPv4 addresses - the use of literal IPv4 addresses
      is a known issue given the approach that is documented in this
      I-D.  Addressing the use of literal IPv4 addresses is out of scope
      for this document.

   o  Unreachable but valid AAAA RR in the DNS - in some cases a valid
      AAAA RR is returns by the DNS, however, if the same is unreachable
      or is not configured the presence of the same will prevent a DNS64
      query which in turn prevents the use of the NAT64 to reach the
      target host references by the address in the AAAA DNS RR.

10.  IANA Considerations

   No IANA considerations are defined at this time.

11.  Security Considerations

   o  The vastness of the IPv6 address space often makes it more
      difficult to scan the same unlike legacy IPv4 only or dual stack
      IP networks.  It is conceivable that IPv6 only network represent a
      reduction in attack surface area which in turn could be viewed a
      security improvement compared to IPv4 only or dual stack IP
      networks.

Internet-Draft         IETF IPv6 only Incremental             March 2017


   o  Given the criticality of the DNS64 for reachability to the NAT64,
      poisoning of one or both could represent a vector for the attack
      of the DNS64 and NAT64 which could in turn impact the end user
      experience.  Worse poisoning of the DNS64 and/or NAT64 could
      result in redirection of end use devices to malicious hosts.  It
      is likely that this vulnerability is no greater in IPv6 only
      networks utilizing DNS64 and NAT64 compared to traditional IPv4
      only or dual stack networks.

12.  Future Work

   The following items are out of scope for this document, however, the
   following are listed as future work items specific to incremental
   IPv6 only deployments:

   o  Support for IPv6 prefix delegation

   o  Disabling IPv4 stacks at some point in the future

   o  Fulling deprecating fallback, legacy IPv4 network
